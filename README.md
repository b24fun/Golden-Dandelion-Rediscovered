# Golden Dandelion Rediscovered
Makes the golden dandelion only obtainable from the sniffer.

This is a simple datapack that adds the ability to the sniffer to dig a golden dandelion and removes the crafting recipe.

Since mojang forgot about the sniffer, I fixed it!


### **Warning**: If you have another datapack/mod/plugin that modifies sniffer drops, they might break, in that case, make a issue on [github](https://github.com/b24fun/Golden-Dandelion-Rediscovered/issues).

You can find it on modrinth at [Golden Dandelion Rediscovered](https://modrinth.com/datapack/golden-dandelion-rediscovered)
