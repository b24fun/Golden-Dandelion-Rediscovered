# Golden Dandelion Rediscovered
Golden Dandelion Rediscovered is a datapack that adds the ability to the sniffer to dig a golden dandelion and removes the crafting recipe so the players can't craft them.

# Compatibility
The datapack is compatible from 26.1 Snapshot 5 to the most recent version.

# FAQ
**Q: Can I have a mod/datapack that modifies sniffer digging drops?**  
A: No, the mod/datapack will most likely break. But if there is demand I will make a compat fix. You can suggest on [github](https://github.com/b24fun/Golden-Dandelion-Rediscovered/issues).

# Incopatible mods/resource packs
